# Program to compare two numbers

# Taking two numbers as input
a = int(input("Enter the first number: "))
b = int(input("Enter the second number: "))

# Comparing the numbers
if a > b:
    print("The first number is greater than the second number.")
elif a < b:
    print("The first number is less than the second number.")
else:
    print("Both numbers are equal.")
